# Seurat Shiny Browser Package Improvements

## ðŸ“¦ Package Conversion Summary

The Seurat Shiny Browser has been successfully converted into a proper R package structure, making it easily installable and shareable. Here's a summary of the improvements made:

### 1. Package Structure

The codebase has been restructured following R package conventions:

```
seurat-shiny-browser/
â”œâ”€â”€ DESCRIPTION              # Package metadata and dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE                  # MIT License file
â”œâ”€â”€ NAMESPACE               # Exported functions and imports
â”œâ”€â”€ R/                      # R functions for the package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ run_app.R           # Main function to launch the app
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.R             # Helper functions
â”œâ”€â”€ inst/                   # Additional package resources
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shiny-app/          # Shiny application files
â”œâ”€â”€ man/                    # Documentation files
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # Project overview
```

### 2. Dependency Management

- Added specific version requirements for 20+ packages
- Configured automatic dependency installation
- Set Seurat 5.0.0+ as the minimum required version
- Added all tidyverse components with version specifications

### 3. Documentation Improvements

- Created comprehensive installation guide (R_PACKAGE_INSTALL.md)
- Updated README.md with package installation instructions
- Added detailed package structure documentation (PACKAGE_GUIDE.md)
- Created roxygen-style documentation for exported functions

### 4. New Features

- Created a flexible `run_app()` function with customizable options:
  - Custom data folder selection
  - Custom port selection (port = 3030 by default)
  - Browser launch control
  - Additional Shiny parameters passthrough
- Added development tools for easier testing and enhancement

### 5. User Experience

- Simplified installation process: `devtools::install_github("davidvi/seurat-shiny-browser")`
- Added clear launch instructions
- Improved error handling and messaging
- Added documentation for common issues and troubleshooting

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Install and run the package with:

```r
# Install the package
devtools::install_github("davidvi/seurat-shiny-browser")

# Launch the application
library(seuratShinyBrowser)
run_app(data_folder = "/path/to/your/data", port = 3030)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Notes

For users of the previous non-packaged version:
- All functionality is preserved in the package version
- Docker usage remains supported
- Data loading/saving operations work the same way
- Core functionality (visualization, clustering, etc.) is unchanged

The package format simply makes installation and sharing easier while maintaining all existing capabilities.
